The boards designed at Stanford implemented a directory-based cache coherence protocol allowing Stanford DASH to support distributed shared memory for up to 64 processors. Stanford DASH was also notable for both supporting and helping to formalize weak memory consistency models, including release consistency.

Fact-check the claim "Monica Lam's PhD advisor is John Hennessy". You think step by step:

# output
The first article says that Monica Lam received her PhD from Carnegie Mellon University and then became a faculty member at Stanford University. The second article mentions that Monica Lam and Hohn Hennessy were co-leading a project at Stanford, which must have happened when Monica Lam was a professor, not a PhD student. Given this, Monica Lam became a colleauge of John Hennessy only after she received her PhD. So John Hennessy could not have been Monica Lam's PhD advisor. So the fact-checking result is "REFUTES".{% if do_correct %}

You rewrite your claim: Monica Lam's PhD advisor is not John Hennessy.{% endif %}

You search the internet to fact-check the claim "The last eruption of Mauna Loa started on March 25, 1984."
[You get these articles:
    Title: 2022 eruption of Mauna Loa
    Article: When active, Mauna Loa tends to produce "voluminous, fast-moving lava flows" of the Hawaiian or effusive eruption type rather than more explosive phreatic or Plinian eruptions, though it has produced explosive eruptions between 300 and 1,000 years ago. Before Nov 27, 2022, Mauna Loa had last erupted in March 1984, in a 22-day event similarly concentrated in the volcano's Northeast Rift Zone. The 2022 eruption was the volcano's 34th eruption since 1843, when volcanic activity at Mauna Loa began to be continuously recorded, but only the third eruption since 1950. The 38-year span between the 1984 and 2022 eruptions was Mauna Loa's longest period of quiescence on record.

    Title: 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa
    Article: The 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa was a Hawaiian eruption in the U.S. state of Hawaii that lasted from March 25 to April 15, 1984. It ended a 9-year period of quiescence at the volcano and continued for 22 days, during which time lava flows and lava fountains issued from the summit caldera and fissures along the northeast and southwest rift zones. Although the lava threatened Hilo, the flow stopped before reaching the outskirts of town.

    Title: Vladimir Tatlin > Biography
    Article: The monument was to be a tall tower made of iron, glass and steel which would have dwarfed the Eiffel Tower in Paris (the Monument to the Third International was a third taller at 400 meters high). Inside the iron-and-steel structure of twin spirals, the design envisaged three building blocks, covered with glass windows, which would rotate at different speeds (the first one, a cube, once a year; the second one, a pyramid, once a month; the third one, a cylinder, once a day). The entire building was to house the executive and legislature of the Comintern, and be a central area for the creation and dissemination of propaganda. For financial and practical reasons, however, the tower was never built.

    Title: Eiffel Tower
    Article: The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: Tour Eiffel) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889. Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution.
